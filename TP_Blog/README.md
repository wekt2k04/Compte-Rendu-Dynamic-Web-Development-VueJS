# TP_Blog

This folder contains the TP (Travail Pratique) blog Vue 3 project.

Quick start (developer):

1. Open a terminal and change to this folder:

```cmd
cd "TP_Blog"
```

2. Install dependencies:

```cmd
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

4. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- This project uses `localStorage` for persistence; posts are stored in the browser.
- Don't commit `node_modules` or `.env` files — `.gitignore` in this folder already excludes them.

Files included:
- `index.html`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js` — standard Vite + Vue setup.
- `src/` — source code (components, views, router, composables, styles).
- `EXLAIN.md` — extended explanation of the code and how data flows.
